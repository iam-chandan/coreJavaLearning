| ------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| Java basics & core syntax      | ✅ Present                   |
| OOP: Inheritance, polymorphism | ✅ Present                   |
| Exception handling             | ✅ Present                   |
| Collections & Generics         | (To be added / in progress) |
