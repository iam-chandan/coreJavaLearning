												TREESET
-> unique elements added
-> sorted in ascending order or natural sorting as per ASCI
-> no null allowed
-> treeSet internally uses comparable interface to store data
-> if directly add custom object then will give classCastException to solve this we have to compare object we do this 
   inheriting comparable class and overriding compareTo() method
-> Time complexity is O(log n)

objects by default not comparable	

O(1) -> constant time
O(n) -> Linear time
O(log n) ->
