										SET
-> set stores unique values no duplicate
-> insertion order not follow means un-ordered
-> only one null allowed
-> set have 3 types 
	1.HashSet
		-> set stores unique values no duplicate
		-> insertion order not follow means un-ordered
		-> only one null allowed
	2.LinkedHashSet
		-> set stores unique values no duplicate
		-> insertion order follow means ordered
		-> only one null allowed
	3.TreeSet	
		-> set stores unique values no duplicate
		-> insertion order not follow means stores in sorted order
		-> no null allowed

-> if two different objects wants to store in a same index then that is known as hash collision to avoid this we use linkedlist inside that index 
   if two different objects are give the same hashCode.
