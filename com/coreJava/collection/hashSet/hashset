												HashSet
-> default capacity is 16
-> load factor -> .75 or 75% of the current capacity
-> threshold -> 12 element
-> 
-> re-hashing :- when the capacity change then again re check all the elements bucket number will change bcz now capacity changed 
   so again with all elements hashCode bitwise and n-1 re do  

1.calculate the hashcode for the element
2.hashcode & (capacity - 1)
3.   
   
   
*Hash Collision
-> if different object/key have same hashCode then hash collision happen bcz both object content not same so it will create a new node next to that node

-> if no collision then searching is O(1)
-> from java8 on words if collision occur more then 8 time in particular bucket then LinkedList will convert entire LinkedList balance binary tree this feature is called treeify
-> same if once balance binary tree created then if we remove some elements from same binary tree till 7 element balance tree will be there if 6 element present the
   again it will convert balance tree to LinkedList.
