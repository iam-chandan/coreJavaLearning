											THREADS
-> it is a sub process which can execute task independently.	
-> Task : smallest unit of work
	ex : printing number is a task
-> process execute thread and thread execute tasks 
-> JVM will create a thread which is called main thread which is rsponsible to execute main method	
-> when multiple threads are there then we can not prdict the execution

**HOW TO CREATE THREADS?
	-> there are 2 ways to create thread
		1. Using Thread class
		2. Using Runnable interface		
-> when we use/extends Thread but not call using start() instade if we call using run() then it will not consider as a thread bcz when we call start()
   that particular thread will schedule in thread schedulaer
