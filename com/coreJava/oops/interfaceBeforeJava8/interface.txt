									INTERFACE before java1.8/8
-> 100% contract based
-> 100% abstract
-> all the methods in interface by default public and abstract
-> variables in interface always abstract or constant
-> constant variables always in upper-case as per industry standard
-> variables always public,static and final in interface
		public static final MAX = 10;
-> with interface we cannot create object same with abstract class
