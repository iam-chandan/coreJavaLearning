							AFTER JAVA 8
-> default methods allowed to achieve back-word compatibility
	default void applyKcc(){}
-> static method means it final common codes store here prevents from code duplicace
	public static void printPassbook(){}	
	
	to call 
	public void printPassbook(){

->MARKER INTERFACE:
	->gives special permission for some special activity . interface without body or empty interface or tag interface.
	inbuild marker interface that are serializable(writing a state of object to file-system/database/network) and 
	clonable(cloning the object/copying object/xerox) 
	ex :- serialization and cloning()
	
	implementing Clonable interface we can clone a class
	-> CloneNotSupportedException when not implement clonable interface
	-> there are 2 types of clonable 
		1. shallow copy/cloning (by default)
		2. deep copy/cloning 
	Serialization :-
	-> it is a process of converting object to byte stream.it is also a marker interface
