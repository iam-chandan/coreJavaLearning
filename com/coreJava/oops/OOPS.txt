											OOPS
->
->if we follow OOPS then our code will be reusable,maintainable,secure,modular
->4 pilers of OOPS 
	1.Encapsulation -> bind data(variables and method) and behavior together .hiding the variables or data (using private access modifire) 
					   and providing public methods.for data security we use Encapsulation.
					-> It is the process of hiding the data
					-> It is created using private variable and public method(setter & getter)
					-> Advantage is security (avoiding unwanted access and modification)
	
	2.Inheritance ->
				  -> if variable or method is private then inheritance is not possible with in class only we can access not able to access outside class.
	3.Polymorphism
	5.Abstraction
