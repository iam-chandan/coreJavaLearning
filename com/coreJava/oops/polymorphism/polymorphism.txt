->There are 2 types of poly-morphism
	1.Runtime poly-morphism(overriding)
	->which method to call decide at runtime
	2.Compile time poly-morphism(overloading)
	->which method to call decide at compile time	
	
1.We cannot override private methods.
2.Access Modifier :-> Cannot reduce the visibility of the inherited method from super class.
	ex :- Default -> default < protected < public ,(private)X
		  protected -> protected < public ,(default and private)X
